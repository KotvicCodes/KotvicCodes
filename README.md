# Hey there 😎

## Who am I 🤓
* I'm Kotvič, junior high school student and self taught programmer  
* My stack contains HTML, CSS and JS  
* Currently, I am working as a freelance web developer  
* I'm interested in all areas of web development, right now I'm working with Neural Networks and how can I implement recommendation engines on the web  

## What I'm working on 💻
I'm currently working on a website called [what2watch](https://what2w.com) which is a Firebase hosted web application which helps you figure out, what to watch using recommender engine. It is still beta though.

## What have I done ❓❗
So far I've made 2 websites, 1 for an metal festival called [Monster of Metal](https://www.monsterofmetal.cz) and second for a local printing office which has sadly not been published yet.  
I have also made plenty of helpful tool for me and my friends, mostly for our everyday life as high school students. One example would be quadratic equation solver which you can find in [Mathemizer repo](https://github.com/KotvicCodes/Mathemizer).
