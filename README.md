# Hey there

## Who am I
I'm Kotviƒç, high school student and self taught programmer.  
My stack contains HTML, CSS and JS.  
Currently, I am working as a freelance web developer.  
I'm interested in all areas of web development, currently working with Neural Networks and how can I recommendation engines also on the web.  

## What I'm working on
I'm currently working on a website called [what2watch](https://what2w.com) which is a Firebase hosted web application which helps you figure out, what to watch using recommender engine. It is still beta though.

## what have I done
So far I've made 2 websites, 1 for an metal festival called [Monster of Metal](https://www.monsterofmetal.cz) and second for a local printing office which has not been published yet.  
I have also made plenty of helpful tool for myself and my friends, helpful mostly for our everyday life as high school students. One example would be quadratic equation solver which you can find in [Mathemizer repository](https://github.com/KotvicCodes/Mathemizer).
